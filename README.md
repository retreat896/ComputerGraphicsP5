## 🎨 Title

### Ocean of Benchy


---

## ✨ Description

The inspiration came from my laziness to complete this assignment. i was thinking to myself what is the most simple thing i could do? and then i remembered the “Benchy” from 3d printing. its the most simple object to most people, but to those of us with experience with 3d printers, we know that this is the most complex thing to ever exist. Thus “Ocean of Benchy” was formed. it started life as a 3d ocean witha  boat sim using p5. but it had hit its limits so i scrapped that idea and created the “2d” platformer that it is now.
